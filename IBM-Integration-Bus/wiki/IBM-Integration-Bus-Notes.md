## Message broker general notes
- Elements of message broker the logical message tree are
	1. **Message**
	2. **LocalEnvironment** - Available within same request. Life is same as life of request.
	3. **Environment** - Available within thread. Life is same as life of thread.
	4. **ExceptionList**
* Default message domain for all input nodes is BLOB.
* InputRoot.*[] is array of all children of InputRoot.

## Message broker node properties
### HTTP Input node
* **Advanced -> Set destination list** (Selected by default)  
    Used with RouteToLable and Route node to create different flow paths based on HTTP method.  
    Use this option to implement REST web service.
* **Advanced -> Label to prefix**  
    With this option labels become Prefix\_GET, Prefix\_POST etc.  
    Use this option to avoid ambiguous label names.
* **Advanced -> Parse query string**  
    Query string parameters available in LocalEnvironment.HTTP.Input.QueryString.
* **Parser Options -> Parse timing** (On demand by default)
    1. On Demand
    2. Immediate
    3. Complete
- **Parser Options -> Build tree using XML schema data types**  
    Used to have data types in tree based on Message Set Definitions.
* **Error Handling -> Maximum client wait time (sec)**  
    Reply should go within this interval otherwise it will send an error.
* **Validation -> Validate** (None by default)
    1. None
    2. Content and Value
    3. Content  
    Note: Even if Content is selected, the SOAP, DFDL, and XMLNSC domains always perform Content and Value validation.
### Compute node  
* **Compute mode**
    1. Message  
    The message contains the modified OutputRoot tree, the original InputLocalEnvironment tree, and the original InputExceptionList tree.
    1. LocalEnvironment  
    The message contains the original InputRoot tree, the modified OutputLocalEnvironment tree, and the original InputExceptionList tree.

## ESQL general notes
* ESQL can be used in following built in nodes
  * Primary nodes
    * Compute node
    * Database node
    * Filter node
  * Secondary Nodes
    * DataDelete node
    * DataInsert node
    * DataUpdate node
    * Extract node
    * Mapping node
    * Warehouse node
* ESQL data type categories and data types
  * Boolean
  * Datetime
  * Null
  * Numeric
  * Reference
  * String
* ESQL Variables
  * To define variable and optionally assign initial value use DECLARE statement. 
  * If no initial value is mentioned then scalar variables are initialized to NULL and ROW variables are initialized to empty state.
  * Change value of variable using SET statement.
  * Variable names are case sensitive.
  * Types of variables
    * External Variables
      * Also known as user defined properties.
      * Defined with EXTERNAL keyword.
      * Exist for entire lifetime of a message flow.
      * Visible to all messages passing through message flow.
      * Value can be changed at design time using flow editor or at deployment time using BAR editor or at run time using Change Manager Proxy (CMP)
  * Normal variables
    * Normal variables are visible to only one message.
    * Defined by omitting EXTERNAL and SHARED keyword.
  * Shared variables
    * Used to implement in-memory cache.
    * Visible to multiple messages passing through a flow.
    * Initialized when first message passes through node.
  * User defined properties
    * User defined properties can be accessed using EXTERNAL keyword on declare statement.
  * Broker Properties
    * Properties related to Broker, Execution Group, Nodes, etc.
  * ESQL Field References
    * Use REFERENCE pointer to set up dynamic pointer to a field in message.
* ESQL Functions
  * defined by CREATE FUNCTION statement.
  * Can return a value.
* ESQL PROCEDURES
  * PROCEDURE has no return value.
  * PROCEDURE name is case insensitive.
  * External database procedure is indicated by keyword EXTERNAL and external PROCEDURE name.
  * Overloaded database procedures are not supported.
* ESQL Modules
  * Begins with CREATE node_type MODULE statement. node_type must be one of COMPUTE, DATABASE, FILTER.
  * Entry point is FUNCTION MAIN 
* ESQL Usage with different nodes
  * Compute node
    * Update/Insert/Delete data in database
    * Update environment and Local Environment Tree
    * Create one or more output messages
    * Propagate parts of message tree to output
  * Database node
    * All as above except it propagates input message as is.
  * Filter node
    * All as above except output message will be propagated to one of TRUE or FALSE terminal.
